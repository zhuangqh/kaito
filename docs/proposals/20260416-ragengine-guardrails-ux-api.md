## Summary

This proposal defines the intended user-facing model for RAGEngine output guardrails.
The goal is to keep the CRD surface minimal while allowing guardrail policy to evolve as
we add more scanners and runtime capabilities.

The proposed user model is:

```yaml
spec:
  guardrails:
    enabled: true
```

Detailed guardrail behavior is stored in a ConfigMap as YAML rather than modeled as
scanner-specific fields in the `RAGEngine` CRD.

## Goals

- Define a small, stable UX entry point for enabling RAGEngine guardrails.
- Keep detailed guardrail policy outside the CRD in a ConfigMap-backed YAML document.
- Allow scanner additions and policy evolution without repeated CRD changes.

## Non-Goals

- Implement the full runtime behavior in this PR.
- Expose scanner-specific configuration in the CRD.
- Finalize streaming, auditing, or error-handling semantics in this document.

## Proposed UX and API Shape

### Minimal CRD Entry Point

The intended user-facing switch is a minimal `guardrails.enabled` field in the
`RAGEngine` spec.

```yaml
apiVersion: kaito.sh/v1beta1
kind: RAGEngine
metadata:
  name: ragengine-with-guardrails
spec:
  guardrails:
    enabled: true
```

At this stage, the proposal does not add scanner-specific CRD fields such as `action`,
`scanners`, `patterns`, or `blockMessage`.

### ConfigMap-Based YAML Policy

Detailed policy is defined in YAML and delivered through a ConfigMap.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: ragengine-guardrails-policy
data:
  guardrails.yaml: |
    blockMessage: The model output was blocked by output guardrails.
    scanners:
      - type: regex
        action: redact
        patterns:
          - 'https?://\\S+'
      - type: ban_substrings
        action: block
        substrings:
          - secret
```

The exact YAML schema can evolve, but the design principle is fixed: detailed policy lives
in ConfigMap YAML, not in the CRD.

### Default ConfigMap Support

If `spec.guardrails.enabled` is `true` and `configMapRef` is not set, the
controller copies the default guardrails policy ConfigMap
(`ragengine-guardrails-policy-template`) into the RAGEngine namespace and mounts
it into the Pod.

- Auto-copied ConfigMaps are namespace-scoped shared resources and do not carry
  an `OwnerReference` to any individual RAGEngine. This avoids deleting a
  shared ConfigMap during cleanup of one RAGEngine while other RAGEngines in the
  same namespace still depend on it.
- User-provided ConfigMaps are not modified or owned by the controller.
- Hot reload is not part of this PR.

The default template provides a conservative baseline of regex scanners for
obvious credential leakage, including:

- PEM private key headers
- AWS access key IDs (`AKIA...`)
- Google API keys (`AIza...`)
- GitHub tokens (`ghp_`, `gho_`, `ghu_`, `ghs_`, `ghr_`)
- `sk-...` style API keys
- `Bearer ...` authorization tokens

This is baseline protection, not a complete content-safety policy. Broader
scanners can still be added via a custom ConfigMap.

### Runtime Failure Semantics

Output guardrails wrap an external ML pipeline (`llm_guard`) whose scanners may fail at
runtime (e.g. GPU OOM, model download failure, tokenizer errors, library bugs). The
runtime is currently hard-coded to fail closed when this happens.

| Env Var                          | Default | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `OUTPUT_GUARDRAILS_ENABLED`      | `false` | Master switch. When `false`, guardrails are bypassed entirely. |
| `OUTPUT_GUARDRAILS_POLICY_PATH`  | `""`    | Path to the policy ConfigMap YAML. When unset, the runtime falls back to the default ConfigMap shipped with the system. |

Behavior:

- **Fail-closed** (current behavior): If a scanner raises during `guard_response`, the
  runtime raises `OutputGuardrailsError`, which the `/v1/chat/completions` handler maps
  to `HTTP 500` with a fixed detail message
  (`"Output guardrails failed while scanning the model response."`). The original
  exception is preserved via `__cause__` for logs, but is not exposed in the HTTP body.
  Users who encounter a problematic scanner can work around it by disabling that scanner
  in the guardrails ConfigMap.

Operator guidance: fail-closed should be paired with model pre-warming, dedicated GPU
quota for guardrails, and Prometheus alerts on `output_guardrails_failed` log volume to
avoid converting transient ML failures into request errors.

Example deployment (fail-closed for a regulated workload):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ragengine-guardrails-failclosed
spec:
  containers:
    - name: ragengine
      image: kaito/ragengine:latest
      env:
        - name: OUTPUT_GUARDRAILS_ENABLED
          value: "true"
        - name: OUTPUT_GUARDRAILS_POLICY_PATH
          value: /etc/ragengine/guardrails.yaml
      volumeMounts:
        - name: guardrails-policy
          mountPath: /etc/ragengine
  volumes:
    - name: guardrails-policy
      configMap:
        name: ragengine-guardrails-policy
```

Sample HTTP response when a scanner fails under fail-closed:

```http
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json

{"detail": "Output guardrails failed while scanning the model response."}
```

Future work may introduce per-scanner fail modes inside the policy YAML; the env-level
switch or CRD/API control can be added later if we need operator-configurable failure
handling.

## Deferred Scope

This proposal defines the UX shape only. The following items are deferred to follow-up
implementation PRs:

- YAML policy loading implementation
- scanner registry and additional scanners
- audit event model
- streaming scanning behavior
- per-scanner fail modes inside the policy YAML

## Follow-Up Implementation Plan

This proposal is intended to support the following implementation sequence:

1. Land the initial non-streaming output guardrails hook.
2. Define explicit error-handling semantics. *(implemented: hard-coded fail-closed
  behavior plus `OutputGuardrailsError → HTTP 500`; configurable failure handling is
  deferred.)*
3. Introduce a runtime YAML policy loader.
4. Add default ConfigMap support. (done — see "Default ConfigMap Support" above)
5. Refactor scanner construction into a registry/factory structure.
6. Add more scanners in small batches.
7. Add audit foundations.
8. Add minimal streaming scanning support.
9. Polish graceful UX and operational behavior.

The CRD exposure for `guardrails.enabled` can be added later if we decide the final user
experience should include an explicit RAGEngine spec toggle rather than relying only on
ConfigMap-based policy.
